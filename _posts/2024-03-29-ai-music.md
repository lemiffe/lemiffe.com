**Note: This post is WIP and will be completed in the coming days.**

## State of the art research in text to music prompts and audio effect generators

- Meta
    - [AudioCraft by Meta AI](https://audiocraft.metademolab.com/)
- Google
    - [MusicLM](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/) (Also: [PyTorch notebook / repo](https://github.com/lucidrains/musiclm-pytorch))
    - [AudioLM](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/audiolm/examples/)
- Stability AI
    - [Stable Audio](https://stability.ai/research/stable-audio-efficient-timing-latent-diffusion): Diffusion-based generative models for latent audio diffusion
    - Had a few demos here that while they were impressive, I would put them on par with Google and Meta’s efforts so far. [Check the official website here](https://www.stableaudio.com/).
    - [Another demo](https://stability-ai.github.io/stable-audio-demo/) that seems to be more recent (and better!)
    - [HN comment](https://www.notion.so/FRUTAL-Dev-ba0914457bcf4ebd8314626784ed3ae8?pvs=21) about Ed Newton-Rex who built stable audio quit after release re training data - he went on to found https://www.fairlytrained.org/
- Generative Music in Games
    - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1875952119300795
    - Could be the most interesting area of research; not talking about typing “eerie music” and popping the wav or mp3 file into the game asset files, but about on-the-fly generation of music that adapts based on the character, story arc, etc. maybe it would work incredibly well for those games that have a bunch of different endings where every choice matters in the decision tree.

## Websites and services to generate music and sound effects with AI

## AI singers and artist imitation

## AI virtual music instruments and VSTs

**Small rant:**

Even though the AI singers imitating known artists generated a lot of drama, in my opinion it pales in comparison to the voice synthesis… I mean, I think a lot of people were frustrated with autotune, it just means you don’t even need to know how to sing, YouTubers such as Roomie [have generated whole series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjGXSgh2kY) of autotune vs real voice... some artists would use it covertly to fix mistakes, but then it spawned a use-case where it was used as a texture, the whole point was cranking it to 10 making it a stylistic choice... And I just think in a way AI voice synthesis for singing means that some people who make a living singing on tracks will maybe make less if producers don’t have to find the right talent anymore, just the right voice. These are my thoughts as all of this is still quite new and I don’t know how it will pay out in the long run, but the pace of innovation in the AI music generation and voice synthesis in general seems to be accelerating, and I’m very curious what’s going to come out next, and how these tools will be used once the dust has settled.

**Other Tools and Services:**

There are a bunch of lists of top AI tools including quite a few I didn’t cover like Orb Producer Suite 3, Playbeat sequencer, Atlas 2, Spark Chords and others... [This website covers some of them](https://www.productionmusiclive.com/blogs/news/top-14-ai-plugins-and-tools-for-music-producers-in-2023-for-mixing-mastering-composition-sequencing-more) if you are interested in more overviews and links to the plugins
