![2015 Album Cover]({{ site.url }}/assets/2015/cover-500.jpg)

[Click here]({{ site.url }}/2015) to listen to the EP! 2015 is an EP inspired by sketches I recorded in 2015 in Belgium and the US. The challenge for this month's EP was to use a different DAW (digital audio workstation) than I am used to, which was tougher than I expected.

After trying out a few free DAWs I realised I'd settle for GarageBand on the mac. It took me 3 weeks just to get into the flow, but once I got into it I noticed my usual way of working wouldn't work; somehow the program you choose to work in can shape the work you produce.

The end result was a "rock demo tape" style of EP. I recorded in longer takes with less comping (recording the same part over and over), instead relying on more practicing beforehand and less recording, as it could be a bit more tedious to do a lot of splicing and adjusting.

Thanks for listening and I hope you enjoy it!
