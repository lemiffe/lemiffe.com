Lemiffe is a songwriter and producer from the UK and Mexico, who currently lives in Belgium as of 2014.

Having written over 15 albums and EPs, his goal is to produce a large body of work combining multiple genres and themes, such as sociology, psychology, technology, AI, addiction and death.

Lemiffe started composing music in September, 2001, just after acquiring his first guitar. The following year he founded the band Distortion in the Mid Range alongside his sister and two friends, with whom he performed for the following five years.

Their music was heavily influenced by music from the early 2000s such as Linkin Park, Deftones, Audioslave, Blink 182, Limp Bizkit, System of a Down, amongst others.

After they separated due to most of the band members moving to different countries, Lemiffe carried on writing music as a solo artist while moving to different countries such as Scotland, Mexico, Ireland and Belgium.

While most of his music is guitar-centric, he’ll often compose songs based on the bass, drums or ukulele, to find different grooves or harmonies that will define the texture and progression of the song.

Some of the topics his music explores include time, the effects of AI on humanity, freedom and its effect on the mind, existentialism, chaos and order, separation and loss, mental health, exploring new lands, geography, parallels between computer science and life, space travel, and stories about humans in odd situations.

When he's not writing music he's writing stories, code, and making videos.
